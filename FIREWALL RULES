âœ… 8. Firewall Summary â€“ How UFW Filters Traffic
UFW acts as a front-end for iptables and applies rules at the kernel level.

It filters incoming and outgoing traffic based on rules.

You define whether to allow or deny connections to ports or IP ranges.

Default behavior: Deny all incoming, allow all outgoing unless specified otherwise.
